# Outstanding Items — Phishield Scanner

**Last updated**: 2026-05-16
**Owner**: SML Consulting (engineering) + Phishield UMA (ops)
**Authoritative source** for items pending across the scanner project.
Consolidates open items from gap analysis SCN-* entries, memory files,
and session-level decisions. Update this file whenever a new
outstanding item lands.

## 1. Hosting / infrastructure

| Item | Status | Owner | Target date |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Cloudflare / Hetzner proxy for `phishield.com/scanner-info`** | Pending hosting-company action | Hosting team | Tuesday 2026-05-19 (WordPress → HTML cutover). Handoff doc at `docs/scanner_info_proxy_setup.md`. Options: static copy (simplest), nginx reverse-proxy (cleanest), Cloudflare layer (long-term). |
| **User-Agent flip back to canonical `phishield.com/scanner-info`** | Blocked by proxy above | Engineering | After hosting team confirms `phishield.com/scanner-info` returns 200. Single-line change in `http_client.py` USER_AGENT constant. |
| **GCP / Vertex AI migration of scanner backend** | Future | Phishield ops + engineering | No fixed date. Adds protected environment + LLM-augmented analysis. When this lands: re-run scanner-info IP-range description; update User-Agent host; migrate `scans.db` from SQLite-on-Render to Cloud SQL Postgres. |
| **Eventual move to Hetzner self-hosted** | Future-future | TBD | After GCP/Vertex experience accumulated. |

## 2. External API budget (Phase 2 unblockers)

| API | Current tier | Required tier for 4,000-cohort | Estimated monthly cost | Action by |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Shodan | Free (1 IP/month) | Paid tier supporting ~30 IP lookups/day | R5-10k/month for 7 months | Before 1 July 2026 |
| SecurityTrails | Free (100/month) | Paid tier for sustained usage | Similar order of magnitude | Before 1 July 2026 |
| VirusTotal | Free (4/min, 500/day) | No upgrade needed | — | n/a |
| IntelX | **Trial expired 2026-04-08** | Pick alternative or remove from pipeline | Decision pending | Before 1 July 2026 |
| HIBP, Hudson Rock, OSV.dev | Free unlimited | No upgrade needed | — | n/a |

## 3. Peer benchmarking rollout (SCN-028)

| Phase | Status | Start date | Source tag |
|---|---|---|---|
| Phase 1 — public reference seed pool | **Live** (bi-weekly via `tooling/benchmark_runner.py`) | 2026-05-16 onwards | `benchmark_pool` |
| Phase 2 — lower-tier-upsell cohort (~4,000 clients) | Pending | 1 July 2026 → ~Feb 2027 (6-9 months at ~25-30/day) | `lower_tier_upsell` |
| Phase 3 — broker opt-in via scan form checkbox | Future | When opt-in plumbing is added; no fixed date | `client_optin` |

**Phase 2 prerequisites** (must complete before 1 July):
- [ ] Export 4,000-client list to CSV (`domain, industry, sub_industry, annual_revenue_zar` columns)
- [ ] API tier upgrades (see section 2)
- [ ] Daily cron / Render scheduled job invoking `py -3 tooling/benchmark_runner.py --source lower_tier_upsell --input-csv ... --limit 25`
- [ ] Phase 2 upsell workflow definition (how to deliver PDFs to brokers / clients)

## 4. Deferred-to-continuous-monitoring track (SCN-026)

| Item | Status |
|---|---|
| Probe-cache SQLite-backed implementation | Interface defined in `http_client.ProbeCache`; default `_NullProbeCache` no-op. Real implementation lands with continuous-monitoring scheduler. |
| Continuous-monitoring scheduler | Open. Estimated 3-4 week build. Requires probe cache + per-tenant scheduling + delta-finding detection + alert-on-change pipeline. |

## 5. Open accuracy items (gap analysis roadmap)

Carried over from v9 / v10 gap analyses. Not blocking but worth flagging:

| Phase | Item | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 4b | CMS admin path detection (dynamic from tech stack) | Open |
| 4c | CDN origin IP leakage | Open |
| 4d | MFA presence on VPN login pages | Open |
| 4e | WAF rate limiting / bot protection detection | Open |
| 4f | DNSSEC validation chain | Open |
| 4h | Exploit Window narrative enhancement | Open |
| 5a | Bug bounty programme detection (HackerOne / Bugcrowd) | Open |
| 5f | retire.js CVE cross-reference | Open |
| 5i-T1 | AI Threat Readiness Tier 1 (externally observable) | Glasswing done; rest open |
| 5i-T2 | AI Threat Readiness Tier 2 (self-reported) | Open |

## 6. Architectural follow-ups (low priority)

| Item | Status |
|---|---|
| Refactor remaining checkers through `HTTP` singleton | `privacy_compliance`, `info_disclosure`, `exposed_admin` done. `payment_security`, `vpn_remote`, `security_policy`, `fraudulent_domains`, and single-request checkers (SSL, WAF, etc.) still use direct `requests.get`. WAF tracker only sees burst probers; widening this gives full WAF visibility. ~3 hrs work, low risk. |
| Enforcement-discount % calibration per regulator | Statutory maxima used everywhere in cat stack. Expected-loss view uses heuristic. Compliance officer should set per-regulator discount %. |
| Civil exposure quantification (POPIA s99 / common-law delict) | Currently qualitative disclosure only. Quantification requires internal-contract data. |
| Tail recalibration with empirical SA cat data | 5× PERT upper bound on `mc_total_breach` is conservative. Calibrate against SABRIC + CISA + IBM SA-specific incident-type data when available. |
| Bias correction on `lower_tier_upsell` benchmark cohort | Cohort may not be SA median; pool composition disclosed in report. Future: source-class weighting in percentile calculation. |
| GPD tail fit MLE upgrade (currently method-of-moments + pure numpy) | scipy.stats.genpareto provides MLE fit but adds dependency. Defer until scipy is acceptable on Render. |

## 7. Documentation / artifacts

| Item | Status |
|---|---|
| User Manual docx regeneration | Auto-regenerated via `py -3 generate_manual.py` whenever `manual_parts/` changes |
| Gap Analysis v10 regeneration | Auto-regenerated via `node generators/gen_gap_v10.cjs` (or root `gen_gap_v10.cjs` if not moved). Outputs to main project path: `C:/.../security_scanner/Phishield_Scanner_Gap_Analysis_v10.docx` |
| FAIR Model Gap Analysis (legacy) | `generators/generate_gap_analysis.cjs` produces `Phishield_FAIR_Model_Gap_Analysis.docx`. Pre-v10 artifact; check if still needed before next regeneration |
| Sensitivity analysis docs | `tooling/sensitivity/sensitivity_analysis*.py` + JSONs + `generators/gen_sensitivity_doc.cjs`. Pre-v10 calibration analysis; verify relevance before next regeneration |
| Legacy gap analysis v6/v7/v8 docx | Archived at `docs/archive/`. Kept for historical reference; not regenerated |

## 8. Document quality rules (cross-project)

Hard rules for all client-facing PDF / docx outputs live in
`C:\Users\sarel\.claude\projects\C--Users-sarel-Desktop-Sarel-Local-Only\memory\feedback_document_quality.md`.
Audit every output against the 12 rules before regeneration. Pre-build
audit gate is rule #0.
