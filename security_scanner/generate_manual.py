    "and exposed services \u2014 without ever attempting to intrude, authenticate, or exploit any system."

add_bullet("No software is installed on the target\u2019s systems.")

add_bullet("CDN/WAF masking \u2014 domains behind CDNs may show CDN IP addresses rather than origin server IPs, potentially missing vulnerabilities on the actual hosting infrastructure.")
add_bullet("Fraudulent domain scanning \u2014 the lookalike domain checker generates a finite set of permutations and cannot detect all possible typosquatting variants. Sophisticated homoglyph attacks using Unicode characters may be missed.")
add_bullet("Shodan data freshness \u2014 Shodan\u2019s InternetDB is updated periodically (not real-time). Recent infrastructure changes may not yet be reflected in results.")

add_bullet("Technology fingerprinting \u2014 deeper CMS version detection and framework identification using multiple detection methods.")
add_bullet("Broker API integration \u2014 REST API for programmatic scan initiation and result retrieval by broker systems.")
add_bullet("Per-checker accuracy improvements \u2014 individual accuracy enhancements for all 26 security checkers based on false positive/negative analysis.")
add_bullet("Dark web monitoring alternatives \u2014 evaluation of alternative dark web APIs beyond IntelX for cost-effective credential monitoring.")
