"""Gate: RSI must be scored on the RESOLVED ZAR revenue, not the vestigial
`annual_revenue` field.

The RansomwareIndex size-multiplier bands are in ZAR. The scan form sends revenue
ONLY as `annual_revenue_zar`, so any scan path that feeds RSI the separate
`annual_revenue` argument pins every form scan to the <R10M "micro" multiplier
(1.12) regardless of real revenue — over-loading RSI (and premium) for every
non-micro client. (Found 2026-06-30: live scanner used `annual_revenue` while the
golden rescore used `annual_revenue` OR `annual_revenue_zar`, so golden — a
different code path — never caught it.)

This gate (a) checks the band logic directly and (b) statically asserts the
scanner RSI call site can't regress to the bare `annual_revenue`.

Exit 0 = pass, 1 = fail (DO NOT DEPLOY).  Offline, network-free.
