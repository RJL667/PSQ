"""Per-category severity, mirroring exactly what each PDF card renders.

WHY THIS EXISTS. The PDF is the scrutinised artefact. Every category card in
pdf_cards.py computes its own traffic light from that category's NATIVE fields
-- open ports, exposed services, a grade letter, a compliance percentage -- not
from a generic `score`. Several categories have no `score` at all.

The dashboard's Risk Factors panel had no access to any of that, so it averaged
whatever `score` fields happened to exist and rendered a verdict from them. On
takealot.com that produced a green "Network Exposure - Low" drawn from
shodan_vulns alone, while the PDF's own DNS card was RED for a confirmed open
FTP port (vsFTPd 3.0.5) that the panel could not see.

Replicating these rules in TypeScript would have re-created the exact fault this
module removes: two implementations of one verdict, free to drift. Instead the
severity is computed once, here, stored on each category during scan assembly,
and read by the dashboard. `adversarial_gate` asserts these rules still match
the colours pdf_cards actually uses.

DIRECTION. Severity is about the finding, not a score: 'positive' is good.
Mapping to the PDF's colour constants:

    positive -> C_GREEN      medium -> C_AMBER
    high     -> C_RED        critical -> C_CRITICAL
    unknown  -> not assessed (the PDF renders _not_assessed_block)
