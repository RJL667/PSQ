"""Client meeting brief: a short, client-facing companion to the full report.

WHY THIS EXISTS. The full report is written for the broker and the underwriter.
When we sit with a client's IT team they need something different: what to do
first, which of their accounts are affected, and how we know. This builds that
from a completed scan.

PASSWORD FINGERPRINTS. Optionally the brief carries a FINGERPRINT of each leaked
password - the first character and the length, e.g. ``K... (9 chars)`` - and
nothing more. The question an IT team actually needs answered is "is this one
still in rotation", and an account owner can answer that from a fingerprint.
Printing the password itself turns a briefing note into a credential dump: a
document that, if mislaid, hands whoever finds it working credentials they did
not previously have. The fingerprint answers the question and cannot be replayed.

Fingerprints are OFF by default and cost money. The scan deliberately persists no
password material at all (``checkers_threats`` stores only has_password /
has_hash booleans), so a fingerprint can only come from a fresh paged query
against the credential source, at one credit per page of 100 records. With
fingerprints off this module makes NO outbound request of any kind and spends
nothing.
