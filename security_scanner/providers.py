"""Central registry of per-provider egress clients (WS0).

One `ProviderClient` per external provider, so every paid/quota'd call routes
through a single controllable seam instead of a bare `requests.*`. Checkers import
the client they need (`from providers import SHODAN`) and call `SHODAN.get(...)`.

WS0 stance — *transparent routing, behaviour-preserving*:
  * **No added retry** (`max_attempts=1`) — checkers that already own a retry loop
    (crt.sh, OSV polling, IntelX polling) keep their exact semantics; checkers with
    none don't suddenly gain extra outbound calls. WS7 turns retry on later by
    raising `max_attempts` here — one edit, no checker touched.
  * **Breaker effectively disabled** (`failure_threshold` enormous) — no mid-scan
    trip changes results today; WS7 lowers it to enable the degrade-don't-fail path.
  * **Gentle per-provider bucket** — pacing only (adds delay, never changes a
    result or which calls are made), the machinery WS5a tightens into real quota
    enforcement and swaps for the distributed (Redis) bucket.
  * **Cache + metering slots empty** — WS6b result cache and WS5b usage ledger plug
    in here later without touching a single call site.

`ProviderClient.request` returns a `requests.Response` (incl. terminal 4xx/5xx,
which the caller still inspects) or `None` when the single attempt raised
(connection error / timeout) — i.e. exactly the cases the old `try/except` around
`requests.*` handled. Migrated call sites map `None` to their existing failure path.
