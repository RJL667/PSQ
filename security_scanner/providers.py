"""Central registry of per-provider egress clients (WS0).

One `ProviderClient` per external provider, so every paid/quota'd call routes
through a single controllable seam instead of a bare `requests.*`. Checkers import
the client they need (`from providers import SHODAN`) and call `SHODAN.get(...)`.

Current stance — *seam established, resilience + metering ON* (WS0 routing with
WS6b/WS7/WS9 now activated; see `_client` below). NOTE: only the success path is
covered by the record/replay regression gates — the failure-path behaviour below is
live but exercised by the non-200 cassettes added under tooling/regression:
  * **Retry ON** (`max_attempts=3`, exp backoff + jitter) for transient failures.
    Checkers that own an outer retry loop (crt.sh, OSV / IntelX polling) keep their
    own semantics; the success path is unchanged (a healthy first-try 2xx never
    retries), which is why the migration gates stay green.
  * **Circuit breaker ON** (`failure_threshold=5`) — after sustained failure a
    provider returns `None` with no network call, so the scan degrades (checker
    marked skipped, scoring redistributes) instead of stalling. A breaker can trip
    mid-loop (e.g. per-CVE NVD enrichment), zeroing the remaining enrichment.
  * **Usage ledger ON** — per-provider daily caps + a retry budget bound an outage
    so it can't retry-storm into rate limits or paid cost. In-process today; the
    distributed (Redis counters mirrored to a Postgres `usage` table) version swaps
    in via the same interface.
  * **Result cache slot** — `make_result_cache()`: Redis single-flight when
    `REDIS_URL` is set, no-op single-box by default (keeps the gates deterministic).
  * **Per-provider pacing bucket** — politeness only; WS5a tightens it into the
    distributed quota bucket.

`ProviderClient.request` returns a `requests.Response` (incl. terminal 4xx/5xx,
which the caller still inspects) or `None` when all attempts fail / the breaker is
open — i.e. exactly the cases the old `try/except` around `requests.*` handled.
Migrated call sites map `None` to their existing failure path.
