        "running directly on the origin (RDP, databases, admin panels), because "

        "Candidate origin IPs are gathered from historical DNS records (via "
        "SecurityTrails — the pre-CDN origin is usually still in the history). "
        "Each candidate is then automatically verified: the scanner opens a TLS "
        "connection to the candidate IP presenting the target domain name and "
        "checks that the certificate it serves actually covers that domain. Only "
        "IPs that pass this certificate match are treated as confirmed origins "
        "and added to the scan — so an exposed service on the real server "
        "surfaces in the report even though the domain is CDN-fronted."

    add_bold_body(
        doc,
        "Verified vs candidate: ",
        "Confirmed origins are labelled ‘verified’ and are scanned in full. IPs "
        "that appear in historical DNS but do not currently serve the domain’s "
        "certificate are listed as ‘candidate (unverified)’ and are deliberately "
        "NOT scanned — they may since have been reassigned to an unrelated third "
        "party, and scanning them would be both inaccurate and inappropriate. "
        "Both lists appear in the report’s Origin IP Discovery card for "
        "transparency."

        "This check is fully automated and requires no broker or analyst "
        "confirmation. The certificate match is the proof of ownership, so the "
        "scanner can act on a discovered origin on its own — while still never "
        "actively scanning an IP it cannot tie back to the target domain."

        "Requirements & limitations: ",
        "Origin discovery runs only when a SecurityTrails API key is configured; "

        "contain the current origin, and an origin that terminates TLS with a "
        "different certificate (or no public certificate) will not be verified. "
        "Absence of a discovered origin is therefore not proof that none exists."
