    _h("add_body")(doc,
        "The Phishield scanner is a passive reconnaissance tool. It collects only information "
        "that is already publicly available on the internet. It does not exploit "
        "vulnerabilities, attempt logins, inject payloads, or modify any data on the target's "
        "systems. In cybersecurity terminology, it performs open-source intelligence (OSINT) "
        "gathering and passive fingerprinting."
    )

    _h("add_body")(doc,
        "When you submit a domain for scanning, the scanner executes a multi-phase pipeline:"
    )

    _h("add_bold_body")(doc, "Phase 1: IP Discovery. ",
        "The scanner resolves the domain's DNS A records to obtain all public IP addresses "
        "associated with the domain. If additional client-supplied IP addresses are provided "
        "(for example, known mail server IPs or secondary data-centre addresses), these are "
        "merged into the scan scope. Every subsequent checker operates against either the "
        "domain name itself or the discovered IP addresses."
    )

    _h("add_bold_body")(doc, "Phase 2a: Lightweight Domain Checkers (Concurrent). ",
        "Approximately 20 checkers run simultaneously against the domain. These include "
        "email authentication (SPF, DKIM, DMARC), HTTP header analysis, WAF detection, "
        "technology stack fingerprinting, breach database lookups, credential leak checks, "
        "dark-web exposure searches, admin panel detection, domain intelligence, privacy "
        "compliance analysis, and more. Running these concurrently keeps total scan time "
        "under control."
    )

    _h("add_bold_body")(doc, "Phase 2b: Heavy Checkers (Sequential). ",
        "A small number of resource-intensive checkers run one at a time after the concurrent "
        "batch completes. These include the SSL/TLS deep analysis (which spawns a subprocess "
        "to evaluate cipher suites, certificate chains, and protocol support) and subdomain "
        "reconnaissance (which queries Certificate Transparency logs and resolves large "
        "numbers of hostnames). Running these sequentially prevents memory exhaustion on "
        "resource-constrained hosting environments."
    )

    _h("add_bold_body")(doc, "Phase 3: IP-Level Checkers. ",
        "For each discovered IP address, the scanner runs a set of IP-specific checkers: "
        "DNS infrastructure and open port scanning, high-risk protocol detection (RDP, "
        "Telnet, FTP, SMB), Shodan vulnerability lookups, and DNSBL blacklist checks. "
        "Results from multiple IPs are merged into a single aggregate view, preserving "
        "per-IP detail for the technical report."
    )

        "Any technologies or software versions detected during earlier phases are cross-"
        "referenced against the OSV.dev vulnerability database (which includes the National "
        "Vulnerability Database / NVD). This enrichment step attaches known CVEs to detected "
        "software, enabling the report to highlight specific, exploitable vulnerabilities "
        "rather than generic warnings."
    )

    _h("add_bold_body")(doc, "Phase 5: Scoring. ",
        "Each checker produces a normalised score. These are combined using category-level "
        "weighting to produce an overall risk score from 0 (critical risk) to 100 (excellent "
        "posture). The risk level is then classified as Critical, High, Medium, Low, or "
        "Excellent based on defined thresholds."
    )

    _h("add_bold_body")(doc, "Phase 6: Insurance Analytics. ",
        "The scanner calculates three insurance-specific metrics: the Ransomware Susceptibility Index "
        "(RSI), which adjusts the technical score for industry risk and organisational size; "
        "FAIR-model financial impact estimates using Monte Carlo simulation with 10,000 "
        "iterations; and the Data Breach Index (DBI), which estimates the organisation's "
        "digital dependency. These analytics feed directly into premium calculation and "
        "underwriting decision-making."
    )

    _h("add_note")(doc,
        "The entire scan typically completes in 5 to 15 minutes depending on the complexity "
        "of the target domain and the responsiveness of external APIs. Progress is streamed "
