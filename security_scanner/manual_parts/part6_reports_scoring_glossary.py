    add_bullet(doc, "2026-07-22: Web-corroborated breach discovery added to the breach-history checker (Section 4.6.1). Because HIBP's breaches-by-domain catalogue is thin, the scanner now corroborates breaches from dated open-source intelligence (reputable news and ransomware leak-site listings) behind a strict headline gate, and a large language model (Claude Sonnet 5) confirms real incidents, clusters coverage into distinct events, and dates each one, producing a breach timeline HIBP alone cannot. Conservative by design and degrades gracefully to a deterministic verdict when the model layer is unavailable.")
    add_bullet(doc, "2026-07-20: Sensitive-credential handling hardened end to end. Leaked account identifiers are now masked at every serving boundary (the API, the interactive dashboard, and every PDF), not only in the report tiers. The encrypted credential export (Section 6.4) was wired to its authorisation flow: a consent attestation plus the authorising user are required, the file is encrypted to the client's key and delivered strictly as a server-issued one-time link that expires and is deleted on first download, and every authorised export is written to an audit trail.")
    add_bullet(doc, "2026-07-06: Retired the legacy Render free-tier deployment; the Google Cloud VM is now the sole production instance. The scanner's public self-identification (User-Agent and scanner-info page) was updated to the VM and its single static outbound IP.")
    add_bullet(doc, "2026-07-03: Reconciled the manual against current scanner behaviour: dual-source Certificate Transparency subdomain enumeration (crt.sh and certspotter, with a low-coverage flag), CVE version-gating disclosure (CVEs shown as 'potential, unconfirmed' where the exact software version is not fingerprinted), and the production endpoint moved to the Google Cloud VM at veilguard.phishield.com/scanner. Includes a document-wide readability and punctuation pass.")
