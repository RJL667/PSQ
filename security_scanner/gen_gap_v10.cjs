The defensible correction is a model-uncertainty loading on the catastrophe tail, NOT a shift of the central estimate (expected loss must not be pulled down, and FAIS cover advice must not change), and to stop double-crediting the WAF (once for the genuine web-layer control, once for the blindness artefact).
